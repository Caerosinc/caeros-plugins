description: Audit and fix PlusVibe cold-email deliverability - sending-account health, SPF/DKIM/DMARC records, warmup, inbox-placement tests, and the blocklist. Use before launching a campaign, when replies or inbox rates drop, when bounces spike, when sending accounts disconnect, or when adding or rotating sending domains.

# PlusVibe Deliverability

Sequence copy decides whether a reply happens. Sender infrastructure decides
whether the email is ever seen. This skill covers the mailbox fleet, warmup,
inbox placement, and suppression. Every tool here requires `workspace_id`,
from `get_workspaces` (`PLUSVIBE_GET_WORKSPACES`), which returns workspaces
keyed `_id`. Never carry a workspace id across a switch of brand or client.

## The two tool surfaces

MCP names are primary. The native provider (`pkg/apps/plusvibe`, AppSlug
`plusvibe`, auth via Settings -> Apps -> "PlusVibe Auth") covers only part of
this domain, and its slugs are not mechanical uppercasings:
`check_email_account_health` is `PLUSVIBE_CHECK_ACCOUNT_VITALS`,
`get_blocklist` is `PLUSVIBE_LIST_BLOCKLIST`, `bulk_assign_tags` is
`PLUSVIBE_BULK_ASSIGN_ACCOUNT_TAGS`. Read the slug from the catalog rather
than transforming the MCP name. **No native equivalent exists** for the
placement-test suite, `update_email_account`, `update_email_account_warmup`,
`mark_email_account_fixed`, or `get_email_account_stats`; those need the MCP
server or the PlusVibe UI. Say so rather than substituting another operation.

## The account fleet

`list_email_accounts` (`PLUSVIBE_LIST_EMAIL_ACCOUNTS`) returns
`{accounts: [...]}` where each account is keyed **`id`**, not `_id`. Reading
`_id` here silently yields undefined. Top level: `email`, `status`,
`warmup_status`, `provider`, `warmup_enb_dt`. Under `payload`: `daily_limit`
and `sending_gap` (campaign throttle), a `warmup` block, `sending_rampup`,
`warmup_rampup`, `tags`, and `cmps`, the campaigns currently sending from
this mailbox. Read `cmps` before touching an account; a live campaign can
lose a sender. `payload.analytics.health_scores` carries
`7d_overall_warmup_health`, the Google / Microsoft / other per-provider
variants, `1d_miss_warmup_rate`, and `3d_bounce_rate`;
`payload.analytics.reply_rates` holds the 7d..90d reply and OOO rates.

**`-1` means "no data", not zero.** Health scores and reply rates use `-1` as
the insufficient-data sentinel, and on live accounts here `3d_bounce_rate` is
routinely `-1` because no campaign mail went out. Never report `-1` as a rate
or call it a clean bounce record. Say the window was empty.
`get_email_account_status` (`PLUSVIBE_GET_EMAIL_ACCOUNT_STATUS`) is the cheap
single-mailbox check, returning only `account`, `status`, `warmup_status`.

## Domain records

`check_email_account_health` (`PLUSVIBE_CHECK_ACCOUNT_VITALS`) takes an
`accounts` array of email **addresses** but answers per **domain**,
deduplicated: twenty mailboxes on five domains returns five rows. Rows land
in `success_list` or `failure_list` carrying `domain`, `spf`, `dkim`,
`dmarc`, `mx` (checked too, not just the three auth records), and `allPass`.
Anything in `failure_list` is a hard blocker, and DNS is fixed at the
registrar rather than through this API, so report the failing record and
domain and hand it back.

## Warmup

Warmup sends mail between seeded mailboxes and rescues it from spam, building
reputation before real volume. A new domain that starts cold outreach without
warmup lands in spam. `enable_warmup` and `pause_warmup`
(`PLUSVIBE_ENABLE_ACCOUNT_WARMUP` / `PLUSVIBE_PAUSE_ACCOUNT_WARMUP`) take an
`email` address. `bulk_update_warmup` (`PLUSVIBE_BULK_UPDATE_ACCOUNT_WARMUP`)
takes `ids` (account ids, not addresses) and a `warmup_status` of `ACTIVE` or
`INACTIVE` only, changing nothing else: it cannot set limits, ramp-up, or a
schedule, so those need `update_email_account_warmup` or
`bulk_update_email_accounts`. `update_email_account_warmup` tunes one account
by `id` and demands ten fields at once including `warmup_schedule`; there is
no partial update, so read the account first and echo current values for
whatever you are not changing.

`get_warmup_stats` (`PLUSVIBE_GET_WARMUP_STATS`) is **workspace-level only**.
Its description mentions `email_acc_id`, but that parameter is not in the
schema: it takes `workspace_id`, `start_date`, `end_date` (`YYYY-MM-DD`) and
nothing else, so do not promise per-account warmup metrics. It returns an
`emailAcc` object whose percentages are **strings** (`"100.0"`), plus per-day
`chart_data`, `total_inboxes`, `total_domains`, and `email_domain_detail`.

For sending performance use `get_email_account_stats` (dates required;
optional `email_acc_id`, `provider`, `tags`), returning `{header, chart}`
with `total_sent_count`, `total_bounce_count`, `bounce_rate`, and reply
counts. Its `open_rate` and `total_open_count` mean nothing unless open
tracking is on: campaigns with `is_emailopened_tracking: 0` report zeros
regardless of reality, so never present 0% opens as a finding without
checking that flag first.

## Placement tests

A placement test sends to seed mailboxes at real providers and reports where
the mail landed. It is the only direct measurement of inbox versus spam.
Parent tests and runs are different objects: `parent_test_id` is used
everywhere except `update_email_placement_test`, which takes the same parent
id as **`test_id`**. Runs use `test_id`.

`create_email_placement_test` takes `name` plus `type` of `AUTOMATIC`
(recurring, the default), `MANUAL`, or `ONE_OFF`, and lands in DRAFT.
`update_email_placement_test` then sets `recipient_config`, `sender_config`,
`content_config`, schedule, and throttle. Its `status` accepts only `ACTIVE`
or `INACTIVE`, never `DRAFT`. `min_intv` is required when `throttle` is
`SEQUENTIAL`, and `no_of_week` plus `days_of_week` when `frequency` is
`WEEKLY`. `get_email_placement_recipient_providers` supplies seed ids for
`recipient_config`, grouped keyed `_id` by account class, each `items` entry
carrying its own `_id` and a `recipient_type`. The live set here is
`PERSONAL_GMAIL`, `GOOGLE`, `MICROSOFT`; read it rather than assuming, since
the tool docs cite examples this account cannot use.

Find existing tests with `list_email_placement_tests` (optional `status` and
`type` filters, sorting, paging) and read one back with
`get_email_placement_test_detail`.

Read results with `get_email_placement_test_summary` (parent aggregate),
`list_email_placement_test_runs` then `get_email_placement_test_run_detail`
or `get_email_placement_test_stats` per run, and
`get_email_placement_test_automatic_result` per sender mailbox (`test_id` +
`sender_acc_id`). Manual tests from `create_email_placement_manual_test` read
back through `get_email_placement_manual_test_result`, and
`duplicate_email_placement_test` clones a configured test onto a new domain
set. `delete_email_placement_test` accepts `all: "yes"`, wiping every parent
test in the workspace; never pass it unless asked for exactly that.

## Blocklist

`get_blocklist` (`PLUSVIBE_LIST_BLOCKLIST`) returns a **bare array**, not a
wrapped object, and pages with `skip` / `limit`. Entries carry `_id` and
`value`, where `value` holds either a full address or a bare domain, so one
entry can suppress a whole company. `add_to_blocklist` and
`remove_from_blocklist` take an `entries` array of addresses or domains. This
is not just hygiene: opt-out and do-not-contact requests are a legal
obligation under CAN-SPAM and GDPR. Treat removal as destructive and confirm
exact entries, since dropping a suppression can put someone who asked to be
left alone back into a live sequence.

## Safety

Most of this domain is Risk **Admin** natively, including
`PLUSVIBE_DELETE_EMAIL_ACCOUNT`, every bulk account operation, and both
warmup toggles. Admin and Delete operations are confirm-first: state which
mailboxes or domains are affected and how many, then wait for a yes. Never
chain a write off a read.

- `delete_email_account` is unrecoverable and orphans every campaign listed
  in that account's `payload.cmps`.
- `bulk_assign_tags` reshapes campaign sender pools as a side effect, since
  tag-selected campaigns update their lists automatically. A tag edit can
  silently change who a campaign sends as.
- `bulk_reconnect_email_accounts` works only when credentials are unchanged;
  Google and Microsoft almost always need a manual UI reconnect. Try once.
- `mark_email_account_fixed` only clears the error flag, so call it after the
  real problem is resolved. With `email` omitted it applies at the API's
  default scope, so pass it.
- `update_email_account` requires `first_name`, `daily_limit`, and
  `interval_limit_in_min` on every call, so changing a signature alone still
  resends the throttle. Read the account first or you will overwrite it. When
  `is_slow_rampup` is `"yes"`, `rampup_daily_limit + rampup_daily_inc` must
  not exceed `daily_limit`, and `apply_all_sign: "yes"` writes the signature
  to every account on that domain.
- `bulk_add_email_accounts` returns acceptance, not results; the real outcome
  arrives by email. Do not report the accounts as added.
- `bulk_update_email_accounts` (`PLUSVIBE_BULK_UPDATE_EMAIL_ACCOUNTS`) takes
  `ids` and writes only the fields you pass, but `daily_limit` becomes
  required once `bulk_is_slow_rampup` is set either way.

**Read shape is not write shape.** Reads expose `payload.sending_gap`,
`payload.warmup.limit`, `.increment`, `.reply_rate`; the matching writes are
`interval_limit_in_min`, `warmup_max_daily_limit`, `warmup_pace_increment`,
`warmup_reply_rate`. Live accounts report `reply_rate` as an integer percent
(35, 48) while the write parameter is documented as `0.0` to `1.0`. Confirm
the intended value instead of copying a read into a write.

## Workflows

### Pre-launch deliverability checklist

Run before `launch_campaign` (`PLUSVIBE_LAUNCH_CAMPAIGN`, Risk Send), never
as part of it.

1. `get_campaign_email_accounts` (`PLUSVIBE_GET_CAMPAIGN_EMAIL_ACCOUNTS`), so
   you audit the mailboxes the campaign will actually send from.
2. `check_email_account_health` on those addresses. Any row in
   `failure_list` stops the launch; report the failing record and domain.
3. `list_email_accounts` and confirm each sender is `status: "ACTIVE"`,
   `warmup_status: "ACTIVE"`, with `warmup_enb_dt` at least two to three
   weeks old. A domain warmed for days is not ready.
4. Check `health_scores`, flagging warmup health below about 90 and treating
   `-1` as unmeasured. Compare `payload.daily_limit` against list size;
   prefer many mailboxes at low volume over few at high volume.
5. Optionally run a placement test, then report a clear go or no-go and ask
   for confirmation. Launching is the user's call.

### Diagnosing a bounce spike

1. `get_email_account_stats` over the spike window and a comparable earlier
   window. Compare `bounce_rate`, not raw counts, since volume may differ.
2. Re-run with `email_acc_id` per suspect mailbox to tell a fleet-wide
   problem from one bad mailbox or domain.
3. Fleet-wide: run `check_email_account_health`, since an expired or newly
   edited DNS record is the usual cause. Isolated: check
   `get_email_account_status`, because a disconnected mailbox and an
   unhealthy one look alike in the stats alone.
4. Check the lead source. Bounces concentrated in one campaign usually mean
   an unverified import, not infrastructure.
5. Recommend, then act only on approval: pause the campaign
   (`PLUSVIBE_PAUSE_CAMPAIGN`), lower `daily_limit` on affected mailboxes,
   and blocklist persistently bouncing domains.

### Rotating in new sending domains

1. Confirm DNS with `check_email_account_health` on the new addresses. Stop
   if `failure_list` is non-empty.
2. Add mailboxes with `bulk_add_email_accounts`
   (`PLUSVIBE_BULK_ADD_EMAIL_ACCOUNTS`) after confirming full SMTP and IMAP
   details with the user.
3. Enable warmup at once via `bulk_update_warmup` with `warmup_status:
   "ACTIVE"`, ramp-up set so volume climbs rather than starting flat.
4. Wait two to three weeks minimum before campaign traffic, tracking
   `get_warmup_stats` for `spam_percent` and per-day `chart_data`. Do not
   shortcut this because the user is impatient; state the risk plainly.
5. Tag the cohort with `bulk_assign_tags` and `action: "ASSIGN"`.
6. Retire old domains gradually: lower `daily_limit` over several days and
   check `payload.cmps` so no campaign is left without senders.
